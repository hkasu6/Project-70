It was pet friendly which was great for our dog and had a mall that was walking distance. It was definitely the best beach experience I've ever had!</p>

            <p>Being an amateur meteorologist myself with an avid interest in natural climate change, the events portrayed in TDAT are of course Hollywoodised and an accelerated version of what happens when an ice age strikes.

                Sure the lines are cheesy but the end message is one of hope. Humans are great at adapting and showing compassion when the situation fits. The special effects for the time were very impressive. I don't think I'll ever recover from that scene where the tidal wave strikes New York. It was awesome at the time and shows that a little bit of CGI goes a long, long way in making a film enjoyable (take note George Lucas, Disney, etc!)

                Unfortunately however, it makes no grounded, scientific and rational link to the fact that a drop in solar activity would result in violently displaced Jet Streams in both hemispheres and the onset of an ice age.

                But don't worry, your breath should offset the effects of the next ice age as it causes global warming apparently. Screaming teenage Swedes tell us so, therefore it must be true. On the other hand, CO2 is also a trace gas accounting for just 0.04% of our atmosphere and actually encourages plant growth with no bearing on world temperatures.

            <p>That mega earthquake was extremely epic though when they looked out the plane and saw a massive piece of land rising and falling into the sea as it tilts.

                All of the earthquakes were epic even the tsunamis the fire. That scene where they were going through that building almost crushed them kinda scared me a bit.

                The sad scene was the Indian scientist dying being the tsunami hit him and drowned. I really love this movie whenever it comes to epic scenes.
                Natural disaster movies always have the most epic scenes in my opinion.</p>

        <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">Green energy could provide a boost for America’s rural communities. Clean energy is a growing economic source for rural communities across the U.S. The sector has employed around 360,000 workers in rural counties as of 2019, accounting for up to 10% of total employment in some counties. Rural areas represent 86% of persistent poverty counties in the U.S. Creating clean energy jobs in these areas provides an opportune solution to combat poverty and deliver a U.S. green recovery after the pandemic. Clean energy is a growing economic engine for rural communities across the United States. The sector—which includes jobs in renewable energy generation, energy efficiency, advanced electric grid development, clean fuels and clean vehicles —employed approximately 360,000 workers in rural counties as of 2019, accounting for as much as 10% of total employment or more in some counties. The sector has also experienced rapid growth in recent years, and with federal investment, can deliver greater benefits still despite industry losses weathered during the coronavirus pandemic. In many regions, clean energy jobs are diversifying the rural economy and helping to transform areas that may otherwise struggle to attract jobs and investments or have been facing years of economic stagnation. </p>

        <h4>2019-2020 Australian Bushfires</h4>
        <img src="fire.png" class="img-responsive col-lg-5 col-md-5 col-sm-5 col-xs-12">
        <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12"> Australia is no stranger to bushfires. However, the 2019-2020 season proved to be unprecedented in many ways. The first major bushfires began even before the official arrival of spring in June and then new out-of-control fires sprung up at the beginning of Sept. 2019. The fire situation worsened significantly at the beginning of November 2019 with increasing temperatures and a prolonged drought. In mid-January 2020, a wave of heavy rain finally brought relief in some areas hit by bushfires but was nowhere near sufficient to extinguish the fires. It did provide a respite for firefighters in some areas who had seen only occasional breaks in the weather in the previous months. Hotter temperatures, drought and high winds escalated the crisis again over the first weekend in February. In mid-February an extremely heavy rainstorm allowed firefighters to contain all of the fires in New South Wales (NSW), although fires continued to burn in Victoria. All of the fires were either extinguished or contained by March 4, 2020 – nine months after the first ones began to burn.</p>
